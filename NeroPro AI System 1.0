say Welcome to Nero, allow me to start your Nero AI. Nero AI uses Mycroft Core technologies. Please wait...
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core.git
cd mycroft-core
bash dev_setup.sh
cd ~/mycroft-core
./start-mycroft.sh debug
#Make sure VNC is activated if you plan to run headless later. do this with the next command for a RPI, or install using the GUI on another board or macOS.
sudo raspi-config
say Currently, Nero only uses Mycroft. But within Mycroft, you can do NUMEROUS things. The Nero Mac App can do so much more. Working on that now.
#Mycroft AI is unstable as of March 23rd, 2022
