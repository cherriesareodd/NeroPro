# NeroPro
Nero Production Readme:
Hey. We'll try to make it work. Test my project using a terminal based interface of linux on macOS, or say commands will not work.
Nero is an app and robot pair designed to help people and assist in daily activities. Nero Mate (the robot) does this, whilst the app doessocial interactions with Nero Mate. Funnily enough, Nero was taken. LOL. Anyway, edits to the code are extremely welcome, and don't worry about errors, I'm sure someone will make it work. Allow me to remind you this is based off of a concept I made in 5th grade, and I'm in 7th at time of writing. So.. Code away. Make sure to use linux based things, this is on a raspberry Pi. Much Luv.
Also: MacOS is my OS of choice. I give full AI credit to Mycroft AI and their technology innovations. Ty, and I'll see you on the other side of the firewall.
# ChromeBook hax as well as fun workarounds for various things.
